# Security Feature Examples

This directory contains example output files from the security workflows to help you understand what to expect when using the features.

## Contents

- **dependency-analysis-report.md**: Example output from the Enhanced Dependency Analysis workflow
- **codeql-report.md**: Example output from the CodeQL Analysis workflow with dependency correlation
- **pr-comment-example.md**: Example comment that gets added to pull requests

These examples are intended to show the format and type of information produced by the security features, without having to run the workflows yourself.

## Using Examples in the Course

If you're following along with the Pluralsight course, you can refer to these examples when the instructor demonstrates the output of each security feature.
